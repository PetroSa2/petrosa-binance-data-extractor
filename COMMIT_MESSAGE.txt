fix: Remove orphaned HPA for binance-data-extractor (#20)

Remove orphaned HorizontalPodAutoscaler that was generating 57,952+
FailedGetScale events over 10 days. The HPA was incompatible with the
service's CronJob-based architecture (batch processing).

Changes:
- Delete k8s/hpa.yaml (orphaned HPA manifest)
- Update README.md with CronJob scaling note
- Add comprehensive documentation (4 files)

Root Cause:
The binance-data-extractor runs as CronJobs (scheduled batch jobs),
not Deployments (continuous services). HPA only works with continuous
workloads and was continuously failing to find the target deployment.

Correct Scaling Approach:
- Schedule frequency: Adjust CronJob schedule (5m, 15m, 1h, etc.)
- Job parallelism: Run multiple pods per execution
- Resource limits: Set per-job CPU/memory limits

Impact:
Before: 57,952+ FailedGetScale events (~240/hour)
After:  Zero events, clean logs, clear architecture
