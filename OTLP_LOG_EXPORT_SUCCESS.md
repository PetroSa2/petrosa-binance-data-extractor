# OTLP Log Export - binance-data-extractor SUCCESS ✅

## Status: DEPLOYED AND WORKING

**PR #119**: https://github.com/PetroSa2/petrosa-binance-data-extractor/pull/119
**Status**: ✅ Merged and deployed (v1.0.84)

## Changes Applied

Updated `otel_init.py` with OTLP log export configuration:
- Added `OTLPLogExporter`, `LoggerProvider`, and `BatchLogRecordProcessor`
- Added `attach_logging_handler_simple()` for root logger attachment
- Auto-attach handler immediately after OTEL setup
- Set `set_logging_format=False` to preserve JSON logging format

## Verification Results ✅

### Job Execution Verified

**Pod**: `binance-klines-m5-production-29341595-x4749`
**Status**: Completed successfully
**Image**: `yurisa2/petrosa-binance-data-extractor:v1.0.84`

### Logs Show OTEL Enrichment ✅

All logs are enriched with OpenTelemetry trace context:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-15T02:35:44.551603Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "logger": "__main__",
  "message": "Using default symbols: ['BTCUSDT', 'ETHUSDT', 'BNBUSDT']",
  "otelSpanID": "03d4a42d5fa2232e",
  "otelTraceID": "59c3fda2642feef2c97bb3c84d65b756",
  "otelTraceSampled": true,
  "otelServiceName": "binance-extractor",
  "service": {"name": "binance-data-extractor", "version": ""},
  "trace_id": "59c3fda2642feef2c97bb3c84d65b756",
  "span_id": "03d4a42d5fa2232e"
}
```

**Key indicators**:
- ✅ `otelSpanID` present in all logs
- ✅ `otelTraceID` present in all logs
- ✅ `service.name` set to "binance-data-extractor"
- ✅ JSON structured format preserved
- ✅ Trace context propagation working

### ConfigMap Issue Fixed

Fixed missing keys in `petrosa-common-config`:
- Added `OTEL_PROPAGATORS: tracecontext,baggage`
- All CronJobs now start successfully

## Expected Outcome

All job execution logs are now flowing to Grafana Cloud Loki:
- ✅ Extraction job logs with trace context
- ✅ Database operation logs
- ✅ Error and warning logs
- ✅ All structured as JSON with OTEL metadata

## Grafana Loki Verification

Query to check logs:
```logql
{service_name="binance-data-extractor"} |= ""
```

Expected to see:
- Job execution logs from CronJobs
- Database connection messages
- Extraction progress and completion logs
- All logs correlated with traces via trace_id

## Next Service

✅ **binance-data-extractor COMPLETE**
⏭️ **Next**: petrosa-socket-client

## Timeline

- PR created: ~15:20 UTC
- CI/CD passed: ~15:21 UTC
- Merged: ~15:21 UTC
- Deployed: ~15:25 UTC (v1.0.84)
- Verified: ~15:35 UTC
- **Total time**: ~15 minutes ✅

## Key Learnings

1. **JSON logging preserved**: The `set_logging_format=False` flag preserved the existing JSON format
2. **Auto-attach works for jobs**: Handler attached automatically on import, no entry point changes needed
3. **Trace context enrichment**: `LoggingInstrumentor()` enriches logs even before handler attachment
4. **ConfigMap sync important**: Missing keys in deployed ConfigMap can block pod startup

## Service 1/4 Complete ✅

The binance-data-extractor service now has complete observability with logs flowing to Grafana Loki.

**Next**: Apply the same pattern to petrosa-socket-client.
