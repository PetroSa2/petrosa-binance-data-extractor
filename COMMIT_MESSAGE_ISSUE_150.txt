fix: resolve BatchSpanProcessor NameError in telemetry module (#150)

## Problem
ALL CronJobs were failing immediately on startup with:
  NameError: name 'BatchSpanProcessor' is not defined

Root cause: AttributeFilterSpanProcessor class inherited from 
BatchSpanProcessor outside the conditional import block, causing
NameError when OpenTelemetry imports failed.

Business Impact: Complete data pipeline failure - no historical
data ingestion, gap detection non-functional, downstream services
starved of data.

## Solution
1. Wrapped AttributeFilterSpanProcessor in conditional import block
2. Added no-op AttributeFilterSpanProcessor when OTEL unavailable
3. Ensured graceful degradation without OpenTelemetry
4. Added comprehensive unit tests (26 tests, all passing)

## Changes
- utils/telemetry.py: Fixed conditional class definition
- tests/test_telemetry.py: Added 26 comprehensive tests
- jobs/*.py: Updated telemetry error handling
- docs/ISSUE_150_FIX_SUMMARY.md: Complete fix documentation

## Verification
✅ All 26 telemetry tests pass
✅ All job modules import without NameError
✅ Telemetry works with and without OpenTelemetry
✅ All acceptance criteria met

## Acceptance Criteria Met
- [x] All CronJob pods start successfully without NameError
- [x] Telemetry initializes correctly when OpenTelemetry available
- [x] Telemetry degrades gracefully when OTEL unavailable
- [x] AttributeFilterSpanProcessor conditionally defined
- [x] All klines extraction jobs run successfully
- [x] Gap filler jobs run successfully
- [x] No regression in telemetry functionality
- [x] Unit tests cover both OTEL states

Priority: P0 (Critical)
