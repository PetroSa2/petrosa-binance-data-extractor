  ```bash
  kubectl create secret generic binance-api-secret -n petrosa-apps \
    --from-literal=api-key=YOUR_API_KEY \
    --from-literal=api-secret=YOUR_API_SECRET
  
  kubectl create secret generic database-secret -n petrosa-apps \
    --from-literal=mysql-uri="mysql://user:pass@host:3306/database"
  ```
- [ ] RBAC policies configured (if required)
- [ ] Network security groups/firewall rules configured

### Database Preparation

- [ ] User created with appropriate permissions:
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE binance_data;
  CREATE USER 'binance_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'secure_password';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON binance_data.* TO 'binance_user'@'%';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  ```
- [ ] Connection tested from cluster
- [ ] Backup strategy implemented

### Configuration Validation
- [ ] Symbols list reviewed in `config/symbols.py`
- [ ] Timeframe schedules validated for your timezone
- [ ] Resource limits appropriate for your cluster
- [ ] Log levels configured appropriately
- [ ] Environment variables set correctly

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Repository Setup
- [ ] Code deployed to production branch
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow configured
- [ ] Docker Hub repository created (`your-username/petrosa-binance-extractor`)
- [ ] GitHub secrets configured: `KUBE_CONFIG_DATA`, `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`, `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`

### 2. Initial Deployment
```bash
# Option 1: Automated via GitHub Actions (recommended)
git push origin main

# Option 2: Manual deployment
./scripts/deploy-production.sh
```

### 3. Verification
- [ ] All CronJobs created successfully:
  ```bash
  kubectl get cronjobs -l app=binance-extractor -n petrosa-apps
  ```
- [ ] No immediate job failures
- [ ] Database tables created automatically
- [ ] Logs show successful API connections

## 📊 Post-Deployment Validation

### Immediate Checks (0-15 minutes)
- [ ] CronJobs are scheduled correctly
- [ ] Secrets are accessible by pods
- [ ] First jobs start within expected timeframes
- [ ] No immediate crash loops or errors

### Short-term Checks (1-4 hours)
- [ ] Data is being written to database
- [ ] All timeframes are running on schedule
- [ ] Resource usage is within expected limits
- [ ] No sustained error rates

### Medium-term Checks (1-7 days)
- [ ] Data quality validation completed
- [ ] Performance monitoring baseline established
- [ ] Alerting rules tested and functional
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested

## 🔍 Production Monitoring Setup

### Essential Monitoring
- [ ] Job success/failure rates tracked
- [ ] Data freshness monitored
- [ ] Resource utilization tracked
- [ ] Database performance monitored
- [ ] API rate limit usage tracked

### Recommended Alerting
- [ ] Failed job notifications
- [ ] Data staleness alerts
- [ ] Resource exhaustion warnings
- [ ] Database connectivity alerts
- [ ] Disk space monitoring

### Monitoring Tools
```bash
# Built-in Kubernetes monitoring
kubectl top pods -l component=klines-extractor
kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp

# Custom monitoring script
./scripts/monitor-production.sh
```

## 🛡️ Security Hardening

### API Security
- [ ] API keys rotated regularly (monthly recommended)
- [ ] IP restrictions enabled on Binance account
- [ ] API permissions limited to required actions only
- [ ] API usage monitored for anomalies

### Kubernetes Security
- [ ] Pods run as non-root user (already configured)
- [ ] ReadOnlyRootFilesystem enabled where possible
- [ ] Security contexts properly configured
- [ ] Network policies implemented (optional)
- [ ] Pod Security Standards enforced (optional)

### Database Security
- [ ] Database access restricted to application only
- [ ] SSL/TLS encryption enabled for connections
- [ ] Database credentials rotated regularly
- [ ] Database audit logging enabled
- [ ] Regular security updates applied

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Resource Tuning
- [ ] Memory limits optimized based on actual usage
- [ ] CPU requests/limits tuned for performance
- [ ] Worker counts optimized for API rate limits
- [ ] Timeout values appropriate for data volumes

### Database Optimization
- [ ] Indexes created for query performance
- [ ] Table partitioning considered for large datasets
- [ ] Connection pooling configured
- [ ] Regular maintenance scheduled (ANALYZE, OPTIMIZE)

### Scaling Considerations
- [ ] Horizontal scaling strategy defined
- [ ] Resource scaling thresholds established
- [ ] Multi-region deployment planned (if needed)
