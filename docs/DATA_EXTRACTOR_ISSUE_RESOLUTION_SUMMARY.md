# Petrosa Binance Data Extractor - Issue Resolution Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Missing NATS Subject Prefix Configuration ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: The `petrosa-common-config` ConfigMap was missing the required NATS subject prefix keys:
- `NATS_SUBJECT_PREFIX`
- `NATS_SUBJECT_PREFIX_PRODUCTION`
- `NATS_SUBJECT_PREFIX_GAP_FILLER`

**Error**: `Error: couldn't find key NATS_SUBJECT_PREFIX in ConfigMap petrosa-apps/petrosa-common-config`

**Root Cause**: The ConfigMap was missing these keys that are required by the data extractor deployment.

**Solution**: Applied the correct ConfigMap from `k8s/common-configmap.yaml` which includes:
```yaml
NATS_SUBJECT_PREFIX: "binance"
NATS_SUBJECT_PREFIX_PRODUCTION: "binance.production"
NATS_SUBJECT_PREFIX_GAP_FILLER: "binance.gap_filler"
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### 2. Missing Database Dependencies ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: The application was missing SQLAlchemy and PyMySQL dependencies required for MySQL database operations.

**Error**: `SQLAlchemy and MySQL driver are required. Install with: pip`

**Root Cause**: The `requirements.txt` file was missing the database dependencies.

**Solution**: Added the missing dependencies to `requirements.txt`:
```
# Database dependencies
sqlalchemy>=2.0.0
pymysql>=1.1.0
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### 3. Docker Image Build Issues ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: The Makefile was building with the wrong image name (`petrosa-ta-bot:latest` instead of `petrosa-binance-extractor:latest`).

**Root Cause**: Incorrect image name in the Makefile build command.

**Solution**: Fixed the Makefile to use the correct image name:
```makefile
build:
	@echo "üê≥ Building Docker image..."
	docker build -t petrosa-binance-extractor:latest .
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Fixes
1. **ConfigMap Updated**: NATS subject prefix keys are now properly configured
2. **Dependencies Added**: SQLAlchemy and PyMySQL are now included in requirements.txt
3. **Docker Image Rebuilt**: New image with database dependencies has been built and pushed
4. **Makefile Fixed**: Correct image name is now used for builds

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issues

#### 1. OpenTelemetry Instrumentation Error
**Problem**: New pods are failing with `exec /opt/venv/bin/opentelemetry-instrument: exec format error`

**Impact**: The new image with database dependencies cannot start due to OpenTelemetry issues.

**Investigation Needed**:
- Check if there's an architecture mismatch in the OpenTelemetry binary
- Verify OpenTelemetry installation in the Docker image
- Consider if OpenTelemetry instrumentation is necessary for the data extractor

#### 2. Deployment Configuration
**Current State**:
- Old pods are running but failing due to missing database dependencies
- New pods are failing due to OpenTelemetry issues
- Deployment is in a mixed state

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Investigate OpenTelemetry Issue**:
   - Check the Dockerfile for OpenTelemetry installation
   - Verify if opentelemetry-instrument is properly installed
   - Consider temporarily disabling OpenTelemetry to test database connectivity

2. **Test Database Connectivity**:
   - Once OpenTelemetry issue is resolved, verify that the new image can connect to MySQL
   - Check if the database credentials and connection string are correct

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Add Database Tests**: Create integration tests to verify database connectivity
2. **Improve Error Handling**: Add better error messages for missing dependencies
3. **Documentation**: Update deployment documentation with dependency requirements

## Commands Used

```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl --kubeconfig=k8s/kubeconfig.yaml get pods -n petrosa-apps -l app=binance-data-extractor

# Apply ConfigMap fix
kubectl --kubeconfig=k8s/kubeconfig.yaml apply -f k8s/common-configmap.yaml

# Build and push new Docker image
make build
docker tag petrosa-binance-extractor:latest yurisa2/petrosa-binance-extractor:latest
docker push yurisa2/petrosa-binance-extractor:latest

# Restart deployment
kubectl --kubeconfig=k8s/kubeconfig.yaml rollout restart deployment/petrosa-binance-data-extractor -n petrosa-apps
```

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve OpenTelemetry Issue**: This is the blocking issue preventing the new image from working
2. **Verify Database Connectivity**: Once OpenTelemetry is fixed, test database operations
3. **Monitor Job Completion**: Ensure that data extraction jobs are completing successfully
4. **Update Documentation**: Document the fixes and new requirements

## Files Modified

1. `requirements.txt` - Added SQLAlchemy and PyMySQL dependencies
2. `Makefile` - Fixed Docker image name
3. `k8s/common-configmap.yaml` - Applied to cluster to fix NATS configuration
4. `docs/DATA_EXTRACTOR_ISSUE_RESOLUTION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Conclusion

The main configuration and dependency issues have been resolved. The remaining OpenTelemetry instrumentation error is preventing the new image from starting. Once this is resolved, the data extractor should be able to connect to the database and complete jobs successfully.
